SQL-based operational and financial analysis of hospital patient data, featuring multi-table joins, age-demographic bucketing, and treatment revenue tracking
Healthcare Management Dashboard

##Project Overview
The Healthcare Management Dashboard is a Business Intelligence solution designed to analyze hospital operations, patient appointments, doctor performance, treatment utilization, billing activities, and revenue generation.

The project integrates data from multiple healthcare-related tables to provide actionable insights that support operational efficiency, patient management, and strategic decision-making.

The dashboard was developed using SQL Server for data preparation and business analysis, while Power BI was used for data modeling, visualization, and KPI tracking.

##Business Problem

Healthcare facilities manage large volumes of patient appointments, treatments, billing transactions, and doctor activities. Without a centralized reporting system, it becomes difficult to:

Monitor appointment attendance.
Track doctor performance.
Analyze treatment popularity.
Evaluate revenue generation.
Identify no-show and cancellation patterns.
Optimize hospital operations.

This project addresses these challenges by creating an interactive dashboard that consolidates operational data into meaningful insights.

##Project Objectives

The dashboard aims to:

Monitor appointment performance.
Analyze patient demographics.
Track treatment demand.
Evaluate doctor effectiveness.
Measure hospital revenue.
Identify appointment trends and peak periods.
Understand payment preferences.
